A collection of notes and code related to testing Next.Js applications. Topics included include unit testing with Jest, integration testing with React Testing Library and creating a mock rest api with Mock Service Worker.

The collection began with notes from a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6NTWVG8eM7Dt43vvzulnIbK">video series</a> on testing from Dave Gray.
